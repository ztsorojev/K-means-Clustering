# K-means-Clustering

**Language:** Python 3.6 <br>
**Library:** scikit-learn

The goal of this project was to learn about regression analysis. We worked on the Network Backup Dataset and applied several regression models to estimate the relationship between a target variable and a set of potentially relevant variables. Cross-validation was used to handle over-fitting, and regularization was used to penalize overly complex models.
